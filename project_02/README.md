For this project 2 we were tasked with making an etch and sketch PCB. 

I was doing pretty well in creating the layouts as well as designing the schamic and making sure that I had all my parts in the library. 

Whenever I treid to start doing routing however, it became much more difficult. i was having trouble with the crossing lines and things of that nature but i do think 
that i understood the overall concept that was trying to be conveyed. 

In all, this was definitely a difficult project for myself and I did as much as I could to get it done.
